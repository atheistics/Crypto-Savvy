WHAT IS BITTELLER?
BitTeller is the World's most affordable Bitcoin ATM.

How Does BitTeller Work?
The ATM owner loads the BitTeller's wallet to a desired amount.  He can then put the BitTeller in his place of business, home, or meeting hall.  It is then ready for friends, customers, or anyone to purchase BTC with cash.  At the end of the day, the owner can then remove bills and reload the BTC if desired.  The owner can be alerted via email notifications for issues such as a low balance, system errors, and daily status reports.  

The BitTeller is very portable, which makes it easy to carry around to different locations. We recommend that the machine be kept in a safe location and be monitored.  In addition, we recommend securing the unit to something to deter theft.  We have optional cable locks that can be purchased, or you can easily remove the two rear rubber feet and bolt to a counter.

BitTeller updates prices every 2 minutes from Coinbase to make sure to keep BTC pricing accurate.  BitTeller allows ATM owners to adjust the pricing to earn money on every BTC purchase.

BitTeller is Perfect for:
College Bitcoin groups, local Bitcoin meetups, coffee shops, retail stores, restaurants or for your man cave.  Buy a BitTeller to enable your customers to buy Bitcoin at your location or just to impress your friends with your new Bitcoin ATM.

What Cryptocurrency Does BitTeller Accept?
BitTeller is currently configured to process Bitcoin.

Blockchain Inovations can build a custom unit for any alt-coin that supports or provides a bitcoinj compatible version of their wallet.  This includes nearly any mainstream alt-coin including: LTC, DOGE, DASH, LSK, ETH, BOX, ION, XEM, FCT, XRP, NXT, PPC, XLM, and more.

Currently BitTeller version 1.0 only accepts one coin, but version 2.0 will include multiple coin support.  All BitTeller v1, are fully upgradeable to v2.0 software updates when that release is available.  If you want to order a BitTeller with a coin other than Bitcoin, please contact support before ordering to ensure we can complete your order.
